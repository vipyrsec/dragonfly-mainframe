    Report a package by sending an email to PyPI with the appropriate format

    Packages that do not exist in the database (e.g it was not queued yet)
    cannot be reported.

    Packages that do not exist on PyPI cannot be reported.

    Packages that have already been reported cannot be reported.

    While the `inspector_url` and `additional_information` endpoints are optional in the schema,
    the API requires you to provide them in certain cases. Some of those are outlined below.

    `inspector_url` and `additional_information` both must be provided if
    the package being reported is in a `QUEUED` or `PENDING` state. That is, the package
    has not yet been scanned and therefore has no records for `inspector_url`
    or any matched rules

    If the package has successfully been scanned (that is, it is in a `FINISHED` state),
    and it has been determined to be malicious, then neither `inspector_url` nor `additional_information`
    is required. If the `inspector_url` is omitted, then it will be that of the most malicious file scanned
    (that is, the file with the highest aggregate yara weight score).
    If the `additional_information` is omitted, the final e-mail sent to the destination address will read
    "No user description provided."
    If either of these fields are included, they override the default value in the database.

    If the package has successfully been scanned (that is, it is in a `FINISHED` state),
    and it has been determined NOT to be malicious (that is, it has no matched rules),
    then you must provide `inspector_url` AND `additional_information`.

    In all cases, the API will provide information on what fields it is missing and why.
    This way, clients may retry the request with the proper information provided
    if they had not done so properly the first time.
